# gulp-front-end-boilerplate ðŸ¥¤

Boilerplate for front-end development using Gulp to handle all the boring tasks nobody wants to do.

## Features

- `src` and `dist` folders to keep things organized
  - `src` folder is where you put your source files. You work here
  - `dist` folder is where gulp will put your compiled files. You don't work here
- Live reload the browser when you update a file in `src` folder
- Handles styles
  - Compiles Sass to CSS
  - Minifies CSS
  - Remove comments
- Handles scripts
  - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
  - Minifies JavaScript
  - Remove comments
  - Concatenates JavaScript files into one
- Handles HTML
  - Minifies HTML
  - Remove comments
  - Updates references to CSS and JavaScript files to use the minified versions
- Handles images
  - Compresses images in WebP, JPEG and PNG formats
  - Compresses SVG files


## Available gulp.js tasks
- `gulp dev` Run this command to start the development server. It will watch for changes in the `src` folder and reload the browser when a change is detected.
- `gulp build` Run this command to build the project. It will compile all the files and put them in the `dist` folder. This is the folder you will upload to your server.
- `gulp clean` Run this command to delete the `dist` folder. This is useful when you want to start fresh. Keep in mind this also deletes the files under `src/js` and `src/css`.

## Folder structure

This is the folder structure of the project. You will work in the `src` folder and gulp will compile the files and put them in the `dist` folder.

Keep in mind that when you clone the repo, `dist/` `node_modules`, `src/js` and `src/css` won't exist. The content of `dist/` will be generated once you run `gulp prod`, `node_modules` will be created when you run `npm install` and `src/js` and `src/css` will be created when you run `gulp dev`.

```
dist/                      # This is where gulp will put the compiled files. You don't work here

## Customize the project
If you want to remove features or add new ones, you can do it by editing the `gulpfile.js` file. The idea of this project is that every task is done by a specific function, that way you can remove or add tasks easily. For example, if you don't want to minify the HTML, you can remove the `optimizeMarkup` function.

## Requirements
- node.js
- npm

## How to use

- Clone this repository
- Create a .env file and add this "TINIFY_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE". You need to replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your own key. You can get a key at https://tinypng.com/developers
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `gulp dev` to start the development server
- Work in the `src` folder
- Run `gulp prod` to build the project when you are ready to deploy it

## Vulnerabilities

Right now this project has 9 vulnerabilities (6 high, 3 critical). However, these vulnerabilities are in the sub dependencies, not in the code of this project, therefore, they don't represent a security risk. You can check the vulnerabilities by running `npm audit`. I will update the dependencies when the maintainers fix the vulnerabilities.
